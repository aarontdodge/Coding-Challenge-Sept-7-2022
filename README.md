## Largest gap in array

Given an unsorted array of length N, and we have to find the largest gap between any two elements of the array. 
In simple words, find max(|Ai-Aj|) where 1 ≤ i ≤ N and 1 ≤ j ≤ N.

### Examples
```
Input : arr = {3, 10, 6, 7}
Output : 7
Explanation :
Here, we can see largest gap can be
found between 3 and 10 which is 7

Input : arr = {-3, -1, 6, 7, 0}
Output : 10
Explanation :
Here, we can see largest gap can be 
found between -3 and 7 which is 10 
```

## Maximum Sum SubArray using Divide and Conquer

Given an array arr[] of integers, the task is to find the maximum sum sub-array among all the possible sub-arrays.

### Examples

```
Input: arr[] = {-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4} 
Output: 6 
{4, -1, 2, 1} is the required sub-array.

Input: arr[] = {2, 2, -2} 
Output: 4 
```
